- [Sorting](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/sorting), [filtering](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/filtering) and [pagination](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/pagination) - classic triforce of the data tables
- [Personalization](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/features/personalization) where the user decides the order and visibility of columns
- [Persistence](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/persistence) to save applied data (e.g. filters) between requests
- [Exporting](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/exporting) with or without applied pagination, filters and personalization
- [Theming](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/theming) of every part of the bundle using Twig
- [Data source agnostic](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/docs/features/extensibility) with Doctrine ORM supported out of the box
