# Summary

The basic usage section went through every available feature in a _very_ basic manner â€” only explaining the absolute minimum required to configure a data table. 
It may suit some cases, but this bundle is much, _much_ more extensive - read through the rest of the documentation to get better understanding of how things work:

* [Type classes](../features/type-classes.md) - to understand how the types and their extensions work;
* [Persistence](../features/persistence.md) - for a deep dive in the persistence system and its adapters and subjects;
* [Proxy queries](../features/proxy-queries.md) - to learn how is the bundle separated from specific ORM and how to integrate custom data sources;
* [Symfony UX Turbo](../features/symfony-ux-turbo.md) - to understand how asynchronicity works out-of-the-box;
* [Theming](../features/theming.md) - to make the data tables fit right into your application;

And if something goes wrong, check the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) section.
