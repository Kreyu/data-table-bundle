# Summary

The basic usage section went through every available feature in a _very_ basic manner - only explaining the absolute minimum required to configure a data table. It may suit some cases, but bundle is much, _much_ more extensive - read through the rest of the documentation to get better understanding on how things work.

The recommended sections to continue reading:

* [Understanding the Types API](../philosophy/understanding-the-types-api.md) - to understand how the types and their extensions work;
* [Adding virtual columns](../advanced/adding-virtual-columns.md) - to display columns with data that, for example, does not exist in the database or the entity itself;
* [Creating custom types](../advanced/creating-custom-types.md) - to create custom columns, filters, actions and exporters, tailored specifically for the project use case;
* [Creating type extensions](../advanced/creating-type-extensions.md) - to extend any type in the system, using the extension classes;
