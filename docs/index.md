# Introduction


This bundle aims to streamline the creation process of the data tables in Symfony applications.

!!! Note
Despite the name, this bundle has **no correlation** with [jQuery Data Tables](https://datatables.net/).
!!!

## Features

- [Type classes](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/type-classes) for a class-based configuration, similar to [Symfony Forms](https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html)
- [Paginating](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/pagination), [sorting](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/sorting) and [filtering](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/filtering) - classic triforce of the data tables 
- [Personalization](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/personalization) where the user decides the order and visibility of columns
- [Persistence](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/persistence) to save user-applied pagination, sorting, filters and personalization
- [Exporting](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/exporting) with or without applied pagination, personalization and filters
- [Theming](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/theming) of every part of the bundle
- [Data source agnostic](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/proxy-queries) with Doctrine ORM supported out of the box
- [Integration with Symfony UX Turbo](https://data-table-bundle.swroblewski.pl/features/symfony-ux-turbo) for asynchronicity
