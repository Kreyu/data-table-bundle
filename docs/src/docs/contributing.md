## Documentation

The documentation is powered by the [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

To locally preview the documentation, first, install the [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) locally.
The installation instructions are available in the ["Getting Started" documentation section](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started).
Then, to build the documentation locally (and rebuild when change is detected), run the following command:

```shell
npm install && npm run docs:dev
```
